# My Media Player

## About

This code defines a class called MyMediaPlayer. The class provides two methods: stream_webcam and check_word. It also includes initialization code that sets up a video capture device and some OpenCV classifiers for facial detection.

## Usage

To use this media player, create an instance of the MyMediaPlayer class and call one of its methods. Here's an example:

```
from my_module import MyMediaPlayer

mp = MyMediaPlayer()

# Stream the webcam feed with face and eye detection
mp.stream_webcam()

# Play music or a video
mp.check_word()
```
The first method, stream_webcam, opens up a window to display the feed from the default camera on your system. It uses OpenCV to detect faces in each frame, and adds bounding boxes around the detected faces and eyes.

The second method, check_word, prompts the user to enter a choice between playing music, playing a video, or displaying information about a book. Depending on the user's choice, it plays either an audio file or a video file using the VLC player library.
